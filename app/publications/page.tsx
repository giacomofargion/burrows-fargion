                    The 2nd edition of Burrows' A Choreographer's Handbook was published in 2024, updating and expanding the book with new ideas and perspectives on choreography. <br /><br />
                    The book is written as a series of questions and observations about choreography and performance, and is intended as a resource to help artists re-examine how they approach their own work and practice. It's designed to allow the reader to browse through and cross reference ideas in any order, and is accessible to artists from all performance disciplines including dance, theatre, music and visual arts. It has sold over 19,000 copies worldwide and been translated into German (Tanz Magazine, 2010), Slovenian (Maska, 2011), French (Contredanse, 2017), Bulgarian (Metheor, 2017), Chinese (Bookman Books, 2020), Korean (Workroom Press, 2022) and Croatian (Acadamy of Dramatic Art Zagreb, 2024).
