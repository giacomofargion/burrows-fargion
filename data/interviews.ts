Catherine Long: What was your ambition in making the film?

Jonathan Burrows: The idea behind Hands was to make a dance that you could only watch on a television. We came up with the image of a pair of life-size hands on the screen, which would dominate the corner of the room and be intriguing enough that you wouldn't change channels.
My original thought was that the hands should be moving with the precision and speed of a pianist's hands. I asked the composer Matteo Fargion to write a piece of music, but instead of using notes he should use six hand gestures. I expected his hands to be a virtuosic blur of movement, but then he turned up with a kind of slow and plodding old man's hand dance. It became the first minute and a half of the film. After that I took over and doubled the speed.

CL: What do you think was particularly successful?

JB: The most interesting thing about the film for me is that it's four and a half minutes of television without an edit, something that is supposed to be impossible.

CL: Would you change anything if you could make the film again?

JB: I'd let Matteo perform it, which he did originally.

CL: What were the themes/ideas behind the work?

JB: You never know what the real subject is until it's in front of an audience, all you can do is to be as true as possible to what's happening while you're making it. In this case the starting point was quite abstract, but it arrived at a very particular atmosphere and attitude which seems to put people in mind of the patience and stoicism of people who works with their hands. Then again this wasn't entirely a surprise because hands carry such strong marks of age and experience, we read them all the time without perhaps knowing it.

CL: Describe the techniques you employed in making the film.

JB: I made five minutes of choreography but then had to cut thirty seconds to allow for the credits. It seems absurd now but it took me hours to decide what to cut, so that the flow of the thing stayed strong. We shot it in one take, with me using a metronome to make sure I finished at the right moment. The lighting was by Jack Hazan, who lit the area of my lap with the care and complexity you would use in lighting a huge stage: every part of the knees and thighs had different shades of shadow and brilliance. Noel Balbirnie was focus puller, running to and fro with a tape measure and keeping up a stream of instructions to me so as to allow an easy shift of focus as the hands came forwards. The director Adam Roberts came up with the slow pan at the start, which we fought hard to try and persuade him to not to do, but which I now see is essential for setting up the patience of the viewer to sit and watch the hands. It takes away the distraction of wondering what else is in the room.

CL: What was the production process?

JB: Because we had no edits we decided to use the money to pay for 35mm film, which would have a special sparkle that might just help the viewer to stay attentive. The problem was the first shoot had a problem with the camera, and we had to use insurance to set up and re-shoot the whole thing one week later. It was heart breaking. But in the end the Arts Council and BBC were happy with the result, and it did get broadcast in several other countries which was probably fairly unusual for a dance film.
Ever since then I've tried to think of another idea for how to make a television film, but I have too much expectation now. When wemade Hands it was a leap in the dark, taken with as much intelligence as we could muster, but also with a lot of naivety to try something new.

    content: `Lawrence Dunn: Clocking in at maybe 200 minutes overall, with an enormous cast, this has got to be the most ambitious project you have both worked together on. Given that it's all split up into little bits maybe it doesn't feel like that, but considered as a single entity, one would have to look at least toward mid- century ballet to find something even slightly on this sort of scale. And yet, all these dances are being quietly released week-by-week onto the web. How did this project come about?

Jonathan Burrows: I had been thinking for a long time about other ways dance might occupy the internet, other than music videos and short clips of spectacular dancing that you might see on Facebook. And the model for me was the year I spent on and off following Tim Etchell's daily political playbill series called Vacuum Days, which ran for the entirety of 2011. Matteo and I had had a two year experience of working with exploratory digital software, motion capture and so forth, as part of William Forsythe's Motionbank project in Frankfurt, so we had some idea of that place where art meets the digital, but what I liked about Tim's project was that it wasn't about things looking digital but rather about the obvious ways we all use software. So we decided to make a project which would take the short form of Facebook postings, but give it this accumulating quality, so it might transcend the usual instant and forgettable nature of dance clips on social media. And the choice to stage each portrait at a table, was made with the understanding that many people would watch them while sat at a table with their laptop, so the watcher sits opposite the performer, sharing a familiar technological situation.

And the project has given Matteo and I a way to engage with making a much bigger kind of piece, with a large number of collaborators, but at the same time working in the way we always work: from the start step at a time, paying attention to detail and focussing everything on the gap between one thing and the next.

LD: I wonder if the dances made for this project might represent a return to an earlier way of working—as the majority of your pieces over the years have been performed not by third-party dancers but by yourselves. One early collaboration was a 1995 dance made for television, called Hands. Was that the last dance made with the camera in mind? How would you compare your approach then to now, twenty years later?

JB: Recently Matteo and I seem to have found more satisfactory ways to invite other people to join us in our work, encouraged perhaps by a moment in dance where collective practice has become important again. And we're very glad about that.

And in terms of making something specifically for camera, yes, I guess for many years we've been more interested in making rougher representations of actual live performance, but 52 Portraits goes back to what we were trying to achieve for camera in 1994 with Hands. In fact for me I would say that I think 52 Portraits is finally a way of continuing the Hands project, which we wanted to do for a long time, and it seems sometimes these things take decades and you just have to wait.

LD: These dances are all called portraits, but it wouldn't be unreasonable to look at all of the two-hander pieces (going back to Both Sitting Duet) as being self-portraits of one kind or another. Would it be wrong to think of your work, generally speaking, as being more interested in portraiture than tableaux?

JB: I think your question touches upon something very interesting about dance, which is the way that no matter how abstract or distanced it seems, there is always a sense of the person revealed. Having said that though, the job of the dancer or performer is usually to resist the autobiographical impulse at all costs, because to embrace it is to reduce other rich and contradictory elements, like more abstract or formal things, and then you risk losing some of the peculiarities and uncertainties which make performance resonate.

If I had to pinpoint the difference between Hands and these pieces, it could be the collective effect-by-osmosis of the duets. We as viewers of your pieces have gotten used to seeing Burrows and Fargion: the effect of this is that, when watching these dances for other people, the style of movement echoes Jonathan's own characteristic movements; and of course pretty much all of the music is played or sung by Matteo. It brought to mind Gilbert and George, who, because they have for so long appeared in every one of their paintings, one now 'expects' to see—even if they are hidden or don't appear at all. With their paintings there emerges (at least with me) a certain 'where's-wally' looking-around-for-them. In other words, the difference between Hands and 52 Portraits is that, in the portraits, Burrows and Fargion are consistently 'in the background'—is this reasonable?

I think you're right that many of the people who've worked on the portraits know our work, and are in some sense in negotiation with it already when they enter the room, regardless of what they propose. This might be dangerous in terms of trapping what happens in a certain too familiar place, but at the same time the more familiar aspects and performance tone of Matteo and I's work creates a common ground where we might meet and move things forwards without too much instruction. And these 52 meetings with different artists are anyway feeding and disrupting and interrogating what Matteo and I do and think and assume and doubt and wish for, so the exchange is mutual, and that's the point of doing it.

LD: There's also something in the duets that feels therapeutic—I fairly often get the feeling that Jonathan is Matteo's therapist. Do you think there's something therapeutic about these portrait dances too?—especially given that the song texts regularly dig into the dancing individual's backstory and childhood, desires, etc.

JB: Well you're right that the therapeutic nature of the dancing body is never far from the surface when we practice or watch dance, but for me the process of 52 Portraits is perhaps more sociological and political. The intention of the lyrics is to throw the usual idea of the perfect, blessed, angelic dancer figure, and focus on more interesting, conflicting and contradicting information and ideas about what a dancer might be and why we might dance, and to expose the hidden politics of dance practice. Matteo and I are interested in counterpoint, both as a love between the parts but also as a friction which causes something else to happen. So for us the lyrics and music of each portrait are about sustaining and at the same time questioning the thing done.

And one of the pleasures of the project has been to experience the skill that dancers have, to be precise and at the same time spontaneous, and to pitch their performance with self-conscious awareness in relation to the camera and the viewer. And all of them come with a different methodology. And for me this is another aspect of the project, that as well as giving equal space to known and unknown artists, it also gives space to different approaches to working, in a way that challenges the way the dominant discourse wants always to simplify and to reject what doesn't conform or no longer conforms.

LD: In this project there is a striking mix of persons doing the dancing. Some are quite well known (Betsy Gregory, William Forsythe, Robert Cohan, Siobhan Davies), while many others are young and relatively unknown. To put it bluntly—what's your relationship with factual biography? In that, with a young dancer whose background is unknown, one could essentially tell any story one would like?

JB: The portraits work like this: I make some exchange with the artist about what they might do, inviting that they start from what is overused, worn out, dug up, archeological and somehow burned into their motor memory; and I suggest that they might trace or map those remnants into the space in whatever way, not to show the moves but just be in the act of engaging with them. And I offer the musical form of La Folia, which Matteo and I worked with extensively throughout 2014, and some use it and others don't and for the ones who don't I suggest other ways of mapping the thing, like a song sung privately in the head, which perhaps contains some sort of questioning. And every person arrives and says the same thing, 'I've had no time, I've got nothing really.' And then they sit down and the work comes out. This all takes no more than an hour or so, and Hugo Glendinning is lighting as he goes and shooting from the start. And when we're done I ask them some stock questions and some questions provoked by the conversation in the room, and I ask for a piece of music that matters in whatever way. And I write the text from the interview on the train home, using what they say verbatim, and I send the lyric and chosen music to Matteo, and Hugo sends him the video, and the music is written very fast. And the performers never hear the music until they see the final portrait. The process is a kind of benign ineptness, built upon a lifetime of working together. The actual skills we use are hardly evident, and the same goes for the dancers. The human body changes too rapidly, and experiences what's happening on a somatic level too intensely to grasp half of what is happening at any given moment, so we learn to deal with the superficial. And to answer your question, it's not about truth or not, it's much messier than that, because that's how the body is.

LD: Was there anything as regards historical models of portraiture that affected the way these dances were composed?—the lighting, for example, is very much chiaroscuro. For me, two different sorts of historical portraiture seemed to be relevant—one being the private, 'at a distance' picture (Vermeer's interiors, for example, or Rembrandt's Woman Bathing in a Stream, whose model was his lover Hendrickje). The sort of pictures which are full of desire, psychology, maybe even a little erotic voyeurism —but very much 'observed' by the artist.

The other sort of picture would be the 'fantasy' or 'character' portrait, where either a stock figure or a real person is bent into a shape or a pose by the artist. These pictures are more rhetorical, and are not seen from 'afar' but are instead very much flatter, with the subject foregrounded almost to a point of disembodiment. Raeburn's The Skating Minister springs to mind. It seemed to me that these dances had these two sorts of portraiture present as models and flitted between them.

JB: I like very much your picture of these two kinds of portraiture, which sound like what Robert Lowell described in poetry as 'the raw and the cooked'. I think both are present in 52 Portraits, and it's usually an accident of who we're working with and what happens on the day. I've been thinking more about this issue since I read your comments and looked at the images of Rembrandt's mistress and Raeburn's skating man, and I've come to the conclusion that sometimes the difference in the gaze that's invited in 52 Portraits is to do with the colour of the clothing which the person chooses to wear. I've noticed that dark clothing leaves the person floating in a space which softens and contains them without distracting us with surface; whereas light coloured clothing places the performer very much within the room, in a more two dimensional and plastic way.

Finally there is within performance, as within the visual arts, an ongoing tension between more objective and more subjective approaches and gazes, and I'm aware that portraiture is a dangerous thing to attempt in a climate resonant with this discussion. However my reason for doing it is not so much to represent or defend a subjective stance, or get into that argument at all really, but rather to use the portrait form as a way to challenge the hierarchies of currency within dance practice which constantly want to place one approach or style above another. And I do this because as an audience member I continue to find extraordinary experiences in the most unlikely and least acceptable of places, regardless of style or conceptual viewpoint. It seems to me that the only criteria really as to what resonates seems to be that the person is more or less consistent and more or less evidently sentient.

LD: One curious aspect of all these dances is their always being done at a table. What was the motivation for this?

Use of tables in contemporary music interests me quite a bit—Tim Parkinson and James Saunders have made a point of doing their duos mostly at tables, directly facing the audience. Plenty of improvisers using electronics also perform using a tabletop set-up. Keith Rowe (of AMM) once said that putting the guitar horizontal on the table did quite a bit to alter the nature of the instrument and its music, so that the music wouldn't come from the torso, and be representative of the ego as it were—but rather would be reflective of the world.

The music for these dances is enigmatic too—it feels both throw-away and carefully laboured. Each is a song, with lyrics referring to the dancer, and each uses a model tune (from Tina Turner, or MIA, or Iggy Pop, or The Roots, or Stravinsky's Les Noces) though I'm not sure they're all that recognisable as they are mostly reconfigured and recomposed (I certainly didn't recognise any). What was the thinking on this?

JB: I think we just liked the idea that someone's ordinary life or ideas, might be sung as though what we are hearing is crucially important. And the act of singing has a way of universalising what has been said.

LD: Do you have any thoughts on informality and formality? There feels something deeply informal about these dances—domestic, at turns—but also something about masks and formality and outward presentation. The music too, is often very informal, but this can sometimes feel jarring somehow, but I don't know 'with what'.

JB: Matteo and I have had a policy for many years of saying yes to any invitations to perform, and then figuring out how to do it afterwards, whatever the space and conditions of working. Hence the title of the new piece we're making, which is called 'Any Table Any Room'. So we might be performing one week in a large proscenium arch theatre, and the next week in a hall without technical equipment. And each of those two extremes requires a different approach to the balance between what is formal and what is informal in the performance, and both qualities must be there in order that the audience members are invited and engaged, and at the same time free. The whole purpose of our performances is to be under the same roof, which is a term we borrowed from the director and performer Jan Ritsema, and the same philosophy applies to the portraits.

LD: There does seem to be a dialogue, both overall, and in the song lyrics themselves, between a certain 'behind-the-scenes-ish-ness'—things to do with funding and the Arts Council, careers, education, boring practicalities—and something deeply lyrical. But then I guess this is a preoccupation of much of your work? (A Choreographer's Handbook swings quite a bit between these two places.)

JB: In dance now there is a slow recognition that artistic practice includes many different elements, including how we deal with the practicalities and with the public face of what we do, and I wanted 52 Portraits to reflect this in a respectful way. We are living through a period when there is a vast infrastructure of arts professionals, waged and protected by holiday pay and pensions and so forth, in ways artists can only dream of. And this class of arts professionals does good work but is also busy creating gateways for artists to pass through or not, and are constantly having to collude with government to create ever increasing bureaucratic mechanisms that we must negotiate. I wanted that 52 Portraits highlighted the voices of artists while quietening these voices of bureaucracy, and one way to do that was to let artists speak directly about the daily job of surviving.

As we are now more than halfway through these dances being released, is there any long-term structure or development across them—even something emerging by accident?

The only principle for curating the project was that it must be people whose work we love. But as the project has developed so it has become clear that it can never give room for everyone who should be there, and so we are looking at ways to make clear at the end that the list of 52 is in no way comprehensive and that it could go on. And we have already been asked would we do it again in another context, and our preferred model would be that the idea is put into the commons and anyone who wanted to make or subvert or do whatever they want with their own portraiture, would be welcome. And the list of 52 is in a sense deliberately random, shifting from known to quite unknown people, through obvious choices but with occasionally surprising choices. And the important thing for me is that everyone is equal under the roof of the project, so when I was asked could someone show just the portraits of older performers as part of another event, I said no, because to single out the older performers would be to make a judgement on their age, and for me there is a politics in the fact of ignoring all the usual hierarchies which stereotype or marginalise artists for whatever reason.

LD: An extra question, not sure about this one: Jennifer Walshe recently fingered you (rather cutely, in a footnote) in MusikTexte, where she was introducing the term 'New Discipline'— meaning a recent tendency toward incorporation of movement and the body and sociality and theatricality in an outwardly musical context.[1] I'm not sure there's anything 'new' or indeed, 'disciplined' about the trend she's noticed (that might have been the point of her term), but anyway, did you have any thought on this? Do you think of what you're doing as expressly new or experimental or revisionist?

JB: Well this is a nice article by Jennifer Walsh and it's very flattering to be mentioned in it, and I think she explains very clearly that her use of the term 'New Discipline' is pragmatic, so as to provoke a recognition of what's happening in terms of this current interest which composers have in performance. And of course this rekindled interest in the performing body is strongly present also in the visual arts. But for me it's what I've always done because I'm a dancer, and I guess the more necessary question I have is why there's been this sudden turn back towards the body, and I think we're all still trying to work that out. Meanwhile Matteo and I tend to be moving in the opposite direction, where we talk of what we do more and more as being music, in order to clarify our position within the continuing conceptual moment in dance. Because we somehow fit in with this conceptual moment, but in other ways we make decisions which disappoint, so we're at pains always to make clear we never promised to entirely fulfil the conceptual obligation, and the reason is that we're busy making music. It's rhetorical but it helps. It keeps our options open.

    content: `Macarena Hernandez: In your workshop, what did the Small Talk format contribute to the choreographic-performance projects/experiences? What are the contributions of this type of conversation for creative production?

Jonathan Burrows: It feels to me that the period of lockdown due to Covid, has allowed a particular moment of reflection within contemporary dance. I mean it has of course been disastrous financially for many dancers, especially in more fragile economies, because of lost teaching, rehearsal and performances. I don't want to underestimate the impact of that, and how it's also been particularly hard for young dancers in training, who don't know what kind of dance world they'll emerge into after lockdown. But at the same time somehow the culture machine paused, and things that usually get drowned out by the marketplace of contemporary dance, had the possibility to feel more validated. And one of those things that touched me in this period of pandemic, has been the quality of meeting together, even online, which is a huge and equal part of the work that dancers do. I mean how dancers communicate and share easily and in an open way, and how dance itself is a model for this being together. Nobody could perform in a theatre or gallery, so this other mode of artistic process revealed itself as equal performance, and that will stay with me.

It seems also that this moment has allowed for more discussion about greater diversity within contemporary dance, which requires listening, and can benefit from the ability of people from different places and demographics to be easily together in the same online space. And most importantly the institutions were ineffective at first, which allowed artists to take the floor. I mean I think we need to prepare ourselves now for what comes next, but I sense something will be held onto from these unprecedented times. So the meeting I had with dance artists through Casa Del Lago in Mexico City, was part of a continuum of reaching out and being reached out to. And by great good fortune it turned out to be a meeting of mature artists, thinking and wondering together, and the wondering went on for some time afterwards through emails.

Somebody reading this might ask, well what were they wondering about? My memory then is that the conversation started with asking do you have a question about choreography. Thinking about it now this seems a bit of an academic start, but it depends how you view the word choreography. In the context of this conversation the questions that came up were about choreography as a felt sense, and as a way of moving through, perceiving, remembering, communicating, imagining and anticipating the world. It's an image of choreography as an unfolding process of mapping experience, in relation to a given environment. This then includes improvisation as an equal way of making dance. So we talked a lot about challenging the binary between set material and improvisation, and about challenging the binary between those who identify as a dancer and those who identify as a maker.

MH: How to conceive choreographic practice from a collective perspective? What does this notion contribute? Could this practice be conceived as a space to try out ways of relating in other levels (such as social, economic or political)?

JB: This is a big question, whether choreographic practice can be conceived from a collective perspective, and I don't know if I can really answer it. On the one hand there is something about dance practice which is always about being in relation to, and about embodied knowledge which accumulates faster when you practice with other people. On the other hand there remains an image of the choreographer as the person who organises other people's experience, and this is despite many years of work by many artists to break down that hierarchy. Recently I find myself wondering if there's a slightly idealised image of collaboration in contemporary dance, which sets up the expectation that everything must be fully agreed before anything happens. In my collaborations with the composer Matteo Fargion, we've tended towards something that looks more like an anarchist perspective, where the person doing something is the person who decides for that thing, but the doing remains fluid and another idea can arise from another direction and be absorbed. The decision to work this way is more pragmatic than politic. It just seems easier to think and physicalise together when things keep moving. Often one or the other of us might begin work on something and not reveal it for quite some time, and then afterwards we'll sit down and discuss it. Then immediately the new idea is handed over for the other to play with, and so it goes on.

I like very much a description I read recently from the anthropologist Greg Downey, who has been studying capoeira with Mestre Nestor Capoeira in New York. Downey describes how at first in capoeira you copy what you see the others doing, and it feels superficial, but you return again and again to that capoeira circle and the superficial movement begins to become a feeling. And as Mestre Nestor Capoeira says, the feeling then becomes 'a vision of life', and one that can help even your economic circumstances. It's about doing together in a way that allows spirit to emerge. You have the same in the hip hop cipher. I was working recently with former B-boy Fouad Nefill at P.A.R.T.S, which is the school of the choreographer Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker in Belgium, and he put it in a beautiful way. He said: "There's an idea which is about entering the cypher by listening, so not with movement or any more tricks, but you prepare mentally to enter. It's also about what way do you want to be driven in the cypher. To dance to beat your opponent isn't always the best way to beat your opponent, sometimes the focus within the cypher is what matters." For me this image of focus within the circle says something about the possibility and power of collective doing and embodiment in dance.

MH: Can you tell us about any thoughts during the process of creating 'Let us stop this mad rush towards the end'?

JB: The performance 'Let us stop this mad rush towards the end', which was shared online as part of the Casa Del Lago event, was a commission for the London Festival of Contemporary Music in December 2019. The invitation was to work with a full orchestra, and the event took place in a large underground industrial space, which had previously been a concrete testing facility within the University of London. We had to work fast, and it was clear from the beginning that there would only be two rehearsals with the orchestra. So with these restrictions in mind we came up with the image of a solo voice at one end of the hall, and far away at the other end an orchestra, and between these two poles a single dancer would tread a constant path backwards and forwards, in an attempt to link the disparate sounds.

Two other things happened which helped shape the piece. The first is that I play English folk music, and my mentor the concertina player Will Duke had said one day that ornamentation in music was a way 'to stop the mad rush towards the end'. I loved this image of rhythmic detail as a way to enter and expand time, so I suggested the singer Francesca Fargion should chant this as a fixed loop over and over. At the same time we asked the orchestra to improvise whatever they wanted, while the dancer Claire Godsmark travelled this huge distance between them. It was complete luck really that it all fell together, and as the orchestra began to sing "Let us stop this mad rush towards the end', it was immediately obvious that the words conjured a sense of environmental urgency. It wasn't what we'd intended but it was there, and it was somehow very moving.

Posted on the MACULTURE website, February 28, 2022

For more than twenty years, the British dancer and choreographer Jonathan Burrows and the Italian musician and composer Matteo Fargion have been developing a body of work at the crossroads of dance, music and performance. With great intellectual rigor, latent humor and a pleasure in creating together, they produce pieces that are both radical and artisanal. The two artists present their pieces Both Sitting Duet and Science Fiction as part of the Conversations Festival Angers, two duets created almost twenty years apart and which explore the same problem: how to translate dance into music, and music into dance. This joint interview with Jonathan Burrows and Matteo Fargion is an opportunity to address the reflections that circulate at the heart of their artistic approach.

Wilson Le Personic: Jonathan, Matteo, you have worked together for over twenty years. How do your respective writings dialogue and circulate in your pair?

Jonathan Burrows: We met over 20 years ago at a musical performance by Matteo. I remember I was ecstatic at the way the musical rhythm of his performance kept changing, sometimes in memory, sometimes in anticipation, and that's a quality that has remained in the work we have. developed together. At the beginning, we divided the work in a rather conventional way: I took care of the choreography and Matteo took care of the writing of the music. Then we decided to merge these roles and since then we have conceptualized, created, rehearsed, interpreted, all our work in an equitable way.

Matteo Fargion: Much of my work is done collaboratively. Sharing responsibility for work makes creation less solitary. For 20 years, we have collaborated with Jonathan on an equal footing and we have developed clear strategies for dividing up the work. It is essential to trust each other's instincts and to be able to quickly let go of an idea that may seem wonderful to one person, but not necessarily to the other. Today, our common experience allows us to no longer need long discussions or negotiations. We have always looked for ways of collaborating that allow everyone to work alone, to initiate new ideas without the need for talks. Then we bring our material to the table and see what happens.

Wilson: How has this collaboration unbalanced your respective practices?

Matteo: As a composer, I remember that I often got frustrated by the realization that the music did nothing but highlight the dance, the lights, the costumes, without anyone really paying attention. on the musical object, except when these different mediums enter into dissonance. Then Jonathan made me realize that different rules apply to music written for dance: it just has to be simpler, even dumber. If the composition is too dense or complex, the music becomes an unmanageable monster against which the movement cannot compete. Jonathan encouraged me to be less precious and less diligent. I would say that a third of our duets contain no music per se, sometimes there is no room for virtuosity and I am often the first to admit it.

Jonathan: For my part, Matteo suggested to me many years ago that I study composition with his teacher, the composer Kevin Volans. We therefore share a common training, sensitivity and mentor. In this sense, I have therefore always considered my choreographic practice to be deeply linked to Matteo's musical practice.

Wilson: You are presenting your duo Both Sitting Duet, created in 2002, as part of the Conversations Festival. What does this piece represent in your career?

Matteo: Both Sitting Duet was the first duet we created together. For me, this piece marks a new stage in our relationship and in our artistic research, and it was also the first time that I went on stage as a "dancer"! I had proposed to Jonathan to translate a piece of music into movement without really knowing what it was going to give. It wasn't a good idea, but it was a good enough start. Six months of hard work later, we had played it in Brussels and no one wanted to keep the show alive beyond this performance... But 20 years later, it has become a kind of essential piece that we have played more than 400 times! But for us, it always remains relevant with each performance and it evolves as time goes by.

Wilson: Could you tell us more about Both Sitting Duet ?

Matteo: Both Sitting Duet is a gestural translation of For John Cage(1982) by Morton Feldman, an elegant and intimate 90-minute piece for violin and piano, bar for bar and note for note. During the creation process, we had never listened to the music but rather followed the written score and found movements that could keep the rhythm.

Jonathan: At the time, we were working with a group of students from PARTS and we had offered to accompany us in this research. The first time we showed them the piece, we hadn't had time to memorize it and we played it with the scores in front of us. They then advised us to keep the scores in sight and not to learn them, like for a concert. And this is how this piece has been performed for 20 years! It is still very open and forces us to listen to each other and to the public watching us. When we go on stage, we try to remain porous to the space we share: if the public laughs, we laugh… if they remain silent, we remain silent.

Wilson: Both Sitting Duet is presented with Science Fiction , your new creation. What connections can we make between these two pieces?

Matteo: These two pieces both involve a process of translating one discipline into another, music through dance in Both Sitting Duet and more or less dance through music in Science Fiction ; both carry the memory of a previous event, which makes it possible to anticipate a future: sometimes one can be right, but sometimes not, but in any case, there is great pleasure in this journey.

Wilson: Could you come back to the genesis of this new duo?

Jonathan: We've always wanted to interpret a piece of music as a dance performance, but we never really found the way to do it. Then, during confinement, the constraint of isolation allowed us to go beyond our limits, as if this strange moment without the possibility of playing allowed us to revisit unfinished ideas that previously seemed impossible to implement. Our parts are often made up of the remnants of parts or processes that didn't work. So Science Fictionbegan with a silent march and a poem that became, after two years, an accumulative musical piece for synthesizers and percussion. But the march and the poem are always there, somewhere, buried in our bodies, when we play. Nothing is ever lost, and for us it is simply part of the continuity of a practice and a process.

Wilson: Matteo, what specific writing tools did you design to compose the music?

Matteo: In our work, we have often used pre-determined empty structures, usually stolen from somewhere, in a completely different context, to organize our material. It's a fun and liberating way for us to work. For Science Fiction , I stuck quite rigidly to a mathematical sequence called Show and Tell, which grows exponentially with each iteration. On the other hand, I would not like the spectators to think that this information is important to understand what we are doing, this principle has just determined the composition of the piece: that is to say if Jonathan plays, if I play or if we play together. The track has 13 sections, which get longer, denser and more complex as it progresses.

Wilson: What do these two pieces say about the evolution of your work over the past 20 years?

Jonathan: In a way, all of our duets are the same: most of them are half an hour long, handcrafted and devoid of theatrical devices. And once each piece is finished and we've played it for a while, the panic sets in: what can we do next? Is there unfinished work we could pick up? I guess we'll keep going the same way until we get bored or people completely lose interest in our experiences.

Aušra Kaminskaitė: What does it mean to break the rules as a choreographer today?

Jonathan Burrows: For many years now the predominant rule within contemporary dance has been that each new generation and each new artist must propose an image of breaking the rules, but in reality of course this becomes impossible because in a field of rule breaking there are no rules to break.
This hierarchy of innovation has ended up excluding many forms and people, because it fosters misunderstandings about what the nature of innovation might be. Contemporary dance has tended, for instance, to prioritise the idea of spontaneous movement as being the most authentic in the way it might challenge physical habits and oppressive regimes of training and so forth, but that approach ignores forms that are built upon the slow transmission and accumulation of specific styles and methodologies of movement that are held in common: for instance hip hop, flamenco, Indian classical dance, many forms of dance from different African countries and so forth. Contemporaneity has been denied to these forms because of a limited view of what it might mean to innovate.

The compulsion to break what came before could be critiqued as a reflection of the capitalist drive to endlessly develop. It's not a very ecological standpoint. I'm much more interested now in how dancers might better honour the knowledge that has accumulated within their bodies, and not always be asked to reject it in favour of this fantasy of the new. Hip hop dance sets a precedent here, in the extraordinary way it constantly innovates, but at the same time respects, acknowledges and represents the lineage of the form.

AK: How to prepare a professional choreographer? What basic skills does a person need to become able gathering a lot of elements and creating an art piece?

JB: I'm really not sure what basic skills somebody would need in order to identify themself as a choreographer. All human beings have extraordinary ability to coordinate and remember complex movement, and all human beings have pleasure in mapping and ordering and disordering themselves in relation to the world they're moving through. It's usually an accident of getting interested in dancing that someone eventually starts to discover the satisfaction of choreographing, and then it goes from there. My experience is that it's not like it gets better or more fun or easier to do as you keep going, it's just a matter of deciding if it's what you want to be doing, and if it is then you try and make sense of it practically and artistically. The important thing is that all the skills you learn by dancing and choreographing are useful in all aspects of your life, and I wish dance schools would talk more about that, rather than being preoccupied with success.

I think the biggest difficulty now is not how to make a piece, but more like how to make your work visible. There are so many dancers and choreographers creating so much work and I love that and am constantly surprised and delighted by what I see, but we're all struggling to catch each other's attention. In the past a performance might linger in the memory, but now it's up there online for a moment and then gets washed away within hours or days by a torrent of other stuff.

There seems to be a slow shift at the moment, however, into a different mode of survival within contemporary dance, which understands with more confidence that the heart of what we do is about all the ways in which we practice our doing and talking and thinking together. Performances are still important, but they're perhaps less of a goal. This became more evident during the pandemic, when the culture machine stopped and for many of us there was a sense of absolute relief and a chance to reflect on what matters. It felt like the art form passed back into the hands of practitioners for a moment and we started to appreciate things about it that perhaps get overlooked or devalued by the market.

AK: Do you think a humour is something an artist can learn? Or is it a matter of personal character?

JB: The problem with humour in the art world is that it's often seen as less important or even less artistic than work that declares its seriousness. I completely understand that, but my perspective has always been that when people speak together there's a constant exchange of smiles and laughter even in the most serious of circumstances, which is born out of a combination of self- consciousness and the innate necessity of showing each other that no violence is intended. For me, therefore, it's very strange if my communication with an audience is marked by the refusal to smile. I don't like the hierarchy of that situation.
People often laugh during the performances that I make with Matteo Fargion, but it's clear we're not doing comedy. The laughter is a response to empathetic memory and anticipation built by the rhythm of what we're doing, and the fact that we make it clear it's ok to relax and smile. Having said that, the main principle for our performances is 'How the audience sits is how we should sit', which means that as in any conversation, the decision to smile or laugh is triggered mutually and can't be forced by one person or the other.

AK: Remembering your own shows, I am curious, how well do you know these disciplines: maths, psychology and clowning?

JB: I would love to be good at mathematics, but as I've become older I've developed a kind of number dyslexia where I randomly swop numbers and find it difficult to calculate money in a shop. It seems clear then that the way Matteo and I use rhythm isn't mathematical. We do count things, but the counting is connected to a felt sense of the rhythm and the proportions of what we're doing, which is how most dance and music works.
In terms of psychology I guess your question is related to the ways in which Matteo and I work with memory and anticipation, but I would describe these things as more to do with cognition than psychology, and I am very interested in that. For me the act of watching a dance performance encourages an experience of embodied thinking, which animates and makes present the ways in which we read the world through movement. This is connected to what the philosopher Alva Noë calls the 'enactive' approach, which understands perception as being premised upon sequenced movement through the world.

As for clowning, I probably have a vestige of bad clowning left over from my years as a ballet dancer in comedic roles, but I've never had an interest in studying it and I think it's quite different from the humour in Matteo and I's performances. I suppose the nearest connection to clowning might be in our habit of not signalling the humour, which in the case of someone like Buster Keaton would be called 'deadpan'. I consciously try not to do it, but I see why somebody might think it.

AK: How do you perceive a concept of emptiness (in any form of your work)?

JB: I used to talk a lot about emptiness in performance, perhaps as a way to reposition what used to be called 'abstract' dance. Calling it 'emptiness' was a defence against the idea that it might be meaningless. Now, however, I've grown to love contemporary performance for the ways in which it often avoids singular meaning, and deals instead with webs of connection over time, which accumulate into a feeling that you take away with you from the theatre. I don't get that in quite the same way from any other art form.

AK: A lot of your and Matteo's works are minimalistic. This leads me to a thought that behind your choreography there is a huge knowledge which would be distracted by using too much (well known) techniques or tricks. However, it means that an audience must work to get to the point. As far as you've experienced, how deep does the audience usually get into your pieces? Or do they usually perceive them just as a pleasure (nothing negative here)?

JB: The work that Matteo and I make sometimes gets called minimal, maybe because we don't do visual theatre and because we use repetition to create rhythm. For me though, I've never really thought of it as minimal, but more like a music performance that focusses on time and presence rather than visual spectacle. The pieces are highly complex with many materials and usually performed at great speed, so they feel very rich from the inside.
I think the other aspect of what we do that marks it as slightly different from many dance performances, is that we don't show an expressive body as a focus of meaning and emotion. I love dance which does that, but we've always enjoyed a slightly different approach. For us perhaps the ideal would be that the accumulation of rhythm and presence and memory and anticipation in our work, triggers physical and imaginative responses from the spectator which are in conversation with our own responses. This approach is not an aesthetic choice, it's just an accident of the fact that I come from the codified form of ballet and Matteo is a musician, so our way of working developed out of the meeting of those skills.

The only way to get a sense whether our pieces communicate to audience members or not is by reactions from different audiences and individuals as we travel around performing. If something doesn't get a response then we keep working at it or in some cases just stop doing it. There's no guarantee of communication, but when it does happen then in that moment it seems worth continuing.

The most interesting feedback we get from audiences is that over the years we've developed a habit of signalling to people at the end that they can come onstage and look at the scores, and nowadays this seems to happen whether we invite people or not. It's become the most important part of the performances really, where people feel comfortable enough to come down and look and talk together, in a way that allows the performance to resonate.

AK: The names of your shows have always been brilliant. In your opinion, how important is it to name a piece correctly (i.e. attractive)?

JB: Finding a title is an important step towards understanding the dramaturgy of a piece. It has to be absolutely obvious, but at the same time open enough to allow an imaginative response. We learned a lesson about obviousness when we made The Cow Piece in 2009, which initially had a strange complicated title that I can't even remember, and then everyone just called it The Cow Piece so we had to change it, and when we changed it the piece started to work.

One of the most exciting moments I've experienced in a theatre was when Trisha Brown performed at the Sadler's Wells Theatre many years ago, and the stage manager walked on at the beginning and said, "Ladies and Gentlemen, Trisha Brown has asked me to notify you that she has changed the title of the first piece this evening, which will now be called 'For MG: The Movie'." There was a sense of being witness to the rebirth of something and it created a tremendous energy. I've no idea who 'MG' is, but I've never forgotten the title or the piece.

AK: I don't think there's a solid answer to my question, but maybe you could contemplate a bit on the ideas, how to resist the rules of market and still become well recognised (since it seems that you and Matteo have done that yourselves)?

JB: The main thing that informs Matteo and I's response to the marketplace is that I find it very hard to make a piece when I've already described it in a funding application or made promises to a promoter, so we've developed a way to try and avoid doing that. It means we've had to severely limit what we do in terms of scale, because our infrastructure is non-existent, but on the other hand it's helped us to keep going by giving us more freedom. For the past 20 years we've have no office or studio and we share everything including conception, creation, rehearsal and administration of the work. We've never had regular funding, but we do occasionally ask for small amounts of money towards research, so we can buy equipment or hire a studio. It's not the only way to work and it has its problems, but things are getting tough and there's something to be said for that kind of self-containment.
The other thing that's shaped our approach to work is that we've both at times been primary carers for our children, so rehearsals at home made more sense and we've tended to avoid artistic residencies. I find also that when you're trying to create something it helps to be surrounded by your own life. There's nothing more bleak than trying to be imaginative in an empty hotel room.

AK: Do you consider yourself a dance-thinker?

JB: I've always identified myself as a choreographer, and choreography is a kind of thinking or questioning. I do a lot of writing also now for publications and talks, and as part of my work at the Centre for Dance Research Coventry University, and in many ways the writing has become another extension of this choreographic thinking and questioning. It's a quality about contemporary dance that I love.
