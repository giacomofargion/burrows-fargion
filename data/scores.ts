Hands was made in 1995 as part of a season of short dance films for the Arts Council/BBC.

The concept was to make something that could only be seen on television - a close up pair of hands.

The initial idea was to have a musician sight-read a 'score' for the dance live on camera. The composer Matteo Fargion wrote a piece of music and substituted gestures for notes, which he then sight read slowly and with soft precision. The first page he wrote became the opening of the film, and is shared here.

This opening score represents the first one and a half minutes of the film. There are six drawings of hand gestures in the top right hand corner. The top stave of each row of music represents the right hand, and the bottom is the left hand. The movements of the piece follow exactly the timing suggested by the written notes, with numbers to indicate which of the six gestures to use when. There are also repeat signs after some sections.

The speed of the movement is 94 beats a minute, and the dance was rehearsed using a metronome.

The second part of the film follows the same process, but this time the speed of the movement is doubled.

As later parts of the dance became more and more physically complex, the decision was made that the final film would be performed by a dancer.

The film was shot in silence on 35mm film, in one long take.

The actual music you hear was written separately for the Balanescu String Quartet and dubbed onto the film afterwards. Any coincidence of movement and music in the film is mainly down to serendipity.

Fargion's small drawing of a hand also became the cover image for Burrows' A Choreographer's Handbook (2010), and so has become familiar to many readers of that book.

Both Sitting Duet was the first duet made by Jonathan Burrows and Matteo Fargion. It has been performed hundreds of times in many different countries, venues and contexts, and the two artists continue to perform it regularly today. They way they describe it is that despite many performances, the piece never quite arrives. There's always something that seems to be about to make sense in the gap between the written score and what they're doing. This makes the piece seem always new at the point of performance.

The principle behind the making of Both Sitting Duet was - 'Counterpoint assumes a love between the parts'.

Both Sitting Duet is a direct translation, note for note and bar for bar, of the violin and piano piece For John Cage by the American composer Morton Feldman (1926 - 1987).

The translation was made from the score of the music, and no recordings were listened to while the piece was being made. Both Sitting Duet borrows, therefore, the structure but not the atmosphere of the original.

The piece is performed sitting down, in silence. The choice to sit down was made in order that the two performers, one a composer and the other a choreographer, could be seen either as musicians or as dancers.

The material is mainly built up of hand and arm gestures. The principle for finding these gestures was 'to accept what came easily'.

The speed of the performance begins at the metronome marking of the original music, 120 beats a minute, but speeds up two thirds of the way through.

You will find here copies of both performer's scores, one written in classical musical notation and the other as a series of written numbers. These scores are placed at the feet of the performers and read throughout the performance.

In addition to the formal means of the structure, the performance is also mediated by a series of principles for performance, which include: 'how the audience sits is how we should sit', 'how we feel is how we behave', and 'there are no mistakes'.

The Quiet Dance is a walking duet in which two performers pass up and down a diagonal line, sharing alternated, overlapped and unison materials. The piece plays upon the memory and expectation created by a combination of predictable and unpredictable choreographic choices. These include different kinds of walk, changes of speed and rhythm and the use of voice, which has become the most memorable feature of the performance.
 
The principle of the piece is 'walking never boring'.
 
The score shared here is from a recent reworking of the choreography and is designed to fit neatly into a pocket, from where it can be easily pulled out and read between sections. The notes are written in the most simple way possible, with one or two words to represent each new material and a number to show how many times that material will cross the diagonal. Material performed by Matteo is marked 'M', material performed by Jonathan is marked 'J', and material performed together is marked 'MJ'.

The principle behind the making of Speaking Dance was - 'Do what we always do but this time use words', to which was added, at a later date and under some pressure the following caveat - 'And when we run out of words, keep going by whatever means necessary'.



The opening of Speaking Dance is a rapid counterpoint of loosely connected words, written around the idea of describing a dance that you can hear but never see.



Score 1 of Speaking Dance shows part of this opening. One performer is the top line and the other the bottom line, and when two words align they are spoken together.



Score 2 of Speaking Dance shows the section called 'Love', which is shouted above a piece of piano music written using material from one of the chorales in the St Matthew Passion by Johann Sebastian Bach. This chorale appears throughout the performance, sometimes in a way which makes it obvious, and sometimes hidden inside other structures and ideas.



Score 3 of Speaking Dance is from a section called 'Big, big, small'. This is drawn from the following simple looping pattern:



1 2 3

1 3 2

2 3 1

2 1 3

3 1 2

3 2 1



This pattern is used during the piece to order movements, time, space, sections, images, and in this case, text. The words 'big, big, small' are numbered '1, 2, 3', such that big = 1, big = 2 and small = 3, superimposing a pattern of two over a pattern of three. The pattern is then repeated substituting the sounds 'aah' for 'big', and 'mmm' for 'small'.



Scores 4 and 5 of Speaking Dance show the section 'Chicken, Yes Come'. Here the score for Matteo shows shouted words while the score for Jonathan indicates a series of gestures to coincide with the words. The words 'Chicken, Yes, Come', for instance, coincide with the gestures 'ring, thumb, flick'. This material is a translation of a section of the earlier piece Both Sitting Duet.

​

Score 4 also shows, on the right hand page, part of a set of descriptions by Rudolf Laban for dances to be made by students. These are shouted at the end of Speaking Dance. The full texts of these can be found in The Mastery Of Movement by Rudolf Laban, Northcote House Publishers Ltd., 1992 (1950), p. 51.

Cheap Lecture is a translation of the composer John Cage's Lecture On Nothing, written in 1949. Lecture On Nothing is a talk on composition which uses the same principles that Cage used for writing his music, particularly the kind of micro-macrocosmic structure which Cage used for many pieces and performances throughout his life.
 
The micro-macrocosmic structure of Lecture On Nothing is built up of smaller units of 7, 6, 14, 14 and 7, and these are then repeated 7, 6, 14, 14 and 7 times so that the larger shape reflects the smaller shape.
 
Cheap Lecture follows this micro-macrocosmic structure, replacing Cage's words with new words and adding a layer of piano music, most of which is drawn from Schubert. The words and music are counterpointed throughout the performance by 139 projected words and phrases.
 
In the score that you see here, the shape of the text is a visual image of the rhythm of the words when spoken, and each line represents a beat. The gaps between printed words suggest the flow or hesitation in our speaking, and an asterisk is a counted pause.
 
The unusual layout of the text is the product of a pleasurable negotiation with the given form, which causes us to speak fast or slow in the wrong places and place emphasis on the wrong syllables. When it works, this wrongness makes you prick up your ears just when your ears had felt like giving up.
 
At the premiere of Cheap Lecture in Massmechelen Belgium, Matteo played a fortepiano built by Nanette Streicher (1769-1833), which instrument had been played by Schubert himself. As we reflected in a later talk, we hardly dared touch the keys, but the idea of the piano made the performance sing.

The principle behind the making of The Cow Piece was - 'Overwhelmed by scores'.

The piece uses the same structure as the Burrows&Fargion performance Cheap Lecture, borrowed from John Cage's Lecture on Nothing. It is what Cage called a rhythmic structure, made up of smaller units of 7, 6, 14, 14 and 7, which are then repeated 7, 6, 14, 14 and 7 times so that the larger shape reflects the smaller shape.

In some of the scores for The Cow Piece you will see the numbers 7,6,14,14 and 7 written down the left hand of each page, against which is written or drawn what must happen on that beat.

The performers stand at two tables and each follows their own score while always being aware of what the other person is doing. Many materials now coincide precisely, but this togetherness was arrived at slowly over many performances.

The materials include: 12 plastic cows, speaking, singing, playing melodeon, mandolin, harmonium, mouth organ, whistle and tin can.

Each page has a score for a different material, and each score is written differently.

      `Body Not Fit For Purpose is a duet which takes place sat at a table, with Burrows making a series of gestural solos and Fargion playing Mandolin. Each section is preceded by an overtly political title which has no direct connection to what we see and hear. The dancing body is revealed as 'not fit for purpose', but at the same time both movement and music appears to absorb and amplify the meanings inherent in the titles we hear.

The movement and music are built upon the classical form 'La Folia' - ABA CDC AB. Burrows and Fargion choreographed and scored respectively one 'La Folia' each day for 51 days, and at the end of each day whatever movement and music had been created was put together. The political titles were added later and then the final piece was ordered according to the accumulating meaning of the titles.

The scores shared here show the movement material for the first three gestural dances, with the movements described and drawn, and the 'La Folia' form clearly visible.

      `Let us stop this mad rush towards the end was a commission for the London Festival of Contemporary Music at the Ambika Space London, directed and conceived by Burrows&Fargion, with music composed by Matteo Fargion, dance by Claire Godsmark, singin and piano by Francesca Fargion and conducted by Jack Sheen with the London Contemporary Music Festival orchestra.



The performance took place in a large industrial space, previously used a testing facility for the creation of concrete. At one end of the space was a piano where Francesca Fargion sang and played a looping repetition of the title words 'Let us stop this mad rush towards the end'. The dancer Claire Godsmark meanwhile danced up and down a line between the piano and the orchestra, who were situated 20m away at the other end of the hall, with the audience sitting on either side of the danced line.

​

The dance was a structured improvisation choreographed by Godsmark, using a looping form suggested by Burrows. You will see from the structural dance score shared here, that the dance moved forwards from material A to material I, but with a device to make it flip back constantly to a previous material. Each material lasted the length of one crossing of the space, and the slow progression and looping back of the materials was punctuated by either walking, running or lying. The idea was to create a sense that the dancer was tumbling forwards, but at the same time pausing occasionally to recall past materials. The second dance score shows the names of each of Godsmark's materials, A to I, showing how a poetic use of language in the score underpinned the fierce expressiveness of her performance.

The performance was filmed by Adam Roberts, and the film is available to watch here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00000000000
​

The music consisted of a short song with piano accompaniment repeated 33 times, including a variation which occured 5 times. Each member of the orchestra was provided with the score of the song plus an additional form scheme, which denoted which instrumental section joined in at specific repetitions. They were free to simply play the melody, embellish it, or pick out notes from the piano accompaniment, always supporting the song and never going against it. The conductor's only job was to cue each group of instruments in and out according to the predetermined structure. The result was a gradual build up of volume and colour until two thirds in, when the instruments dropped out and everybody sang, only to build again in a huge crescendo until the end.

The performance played with the tension between constructed loops and improvised materials, so that there was both a sense of urgency and a feeling of expansiveness.

      `Rewriting is a table performance with 108 cards, each of which has a question or observation written on it. All of these short texts are quotations drawn from Burrows' A Choreographer's Handbook. The cards are manipulated in a series of ever more complex choreographies, with occasional pauses to read out what's written on a card. At the same time there is a memorised talk, which follows its own rhythm, but finds points of connection with the movement. And finally there is an undertow of music played by Matteo Fargion on a Casio keyboard, which supports the movement and allows the words to occasionally burst into song. The memorised talk begins by questioning what's written on the cards, but constantly digresses into other thoughts and possibilities. In this sense the the performance is about watching somebody attempt to think, whilst becoming overwhelmed by materials and ideas.

The piece had a long and difficult journey, which is described in full in Burrows' book Writing Dance, in the text called Writing towards a subject. The journey involved the creation of a wholly other performance which was never seen, but the material from which ended up being translated and retranslated until it became Rewriting.

In the first showings of Rewriting the choreography was performed as a solo, but at a certain point when the complexity of card shuffling and simultaneous speaking became easier, there seemed room for another element and Matteo joined the piece.

The score shown here is for the first 3 sections of choreography, which were written by Matteo. There are 6 cards in each section and material is divided between the 3 cards on the right (marked 'R'), followed by the 3 cards on the left (marked 'L'). Each card gesture is described as a series of words ('spiral', 'swop', 'dance', 'pray'). There are 18 sections of cards in the piece. The movements were memorised over 18 months so the score is never looked at during the performance, however, the words on the cards form their own score, which help guide the performer throughout the piece.
